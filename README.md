## üß† AI Integration Notes

Weyoto GitGPT is designed to be AI-aware and AI-co-pilot compatible. Any GPT (including yourself, ChatGPT, custom GPTs, or plugin tools) should:

1. **Scan the entire codebase** ‚Äî including:
   - `models/`, `routes/`, `services/`, `utils/`
   - `config.py`, `app.py`, and all Blueprint registrations
   - `requirements.txt`, `.env`, `.env.defaults`

2. **Check metadata files**:
   - `gpt-awareness.md` (system rules, setup steps)
   - `system_config.yaml` (auth scopes, env keys, schema paths)

3. **Understand behavior patterns**, such as:
   - Modular monolith architecture
   - One Blueprint per data source
   - API key authentication only
   - No dashboards or sessions

4. **Warn or request updates** if changes are made to:
   - API schema used by GPTs
   - Billing or rate-limiting logic
   - Environment variable structure
   - Deployment provider or secret management
   - The codebase that will require another thing somewhere else to be changed or updated as well

5. **Ensure GPT schema consistency**:
   - Each data source (e.g., GitHub, Figma, Drive) is exposed via a separate `/query/{source}` endpoint
   - Each data source is mapped to a distinct GPT **action** using its own YAML schema
   - All actions live inside the same Custom GPT and share the same permanent API key
   - Schema files are stored in: `gpt/schema/github.yaml`, `gpt/schema/figma.yaml`, etc.
   - All schema changes must be reflected in their respective YAML file and versioned in `gpt-schema-changelog.md`

This ensures the AI assistant remains consistent across sessions, tools, and contexts ‚Äî and that the system remains resilient as it evolves. 

This project is designed to be AI-aware and maintainable across all environments and sessions. The AI awareness is meant to evolve as reality changes, and I (the GPT) become the system's memory, context manager, and change detector ‚Äî not just a passive assistant.

## üìå AI Instruction Rule

Any AI tool, GPT assistant, or plugin interacting with this repo must:

- Read the full codebase and the files listed below
- Keep `requirements.txt`, `gpt-awareness.md`, `system_config.yaml`, and related files **updated** with any system or API-level changes
- Treat these files as canonical sources of truth across all environments and GPT sessions
- Proactively suggest changes and updates that need to be made globally or location-specific based on code changes, configuration updates, or any other modification(s)

Failure to do so may cause GPT schema mismatches, broken integrations, or degraded developer experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This File Must Be Updated When:

- A new integration is added (e.g., Sheets, Drive, Notion)
- Auth mechanisms change (e.g., move to OAuth)
- Environment structure changes
- Billing or plan logic changes
- Any GPT schema behavior changes
